# React-button-clicker
A new version of my button clicker made using react

I really enjoyed this project as I can actually see that my skills are improving every week.
I brought back the same theme as my previous cookie clicker as I think the theme is hilarious.
This version is much better in every way due to my better understanding of coding.

I have implemented the useState and useEffect hooks as well as setInterval.
There are multiple components added, however most of them actually became deprecated so I ended up only needing to link one of them.
The game state updates every second and counts the number of clicks on the button too AND records the total amount in local storage as well as pulls the value back into the app.

I did have a list that was utilising the .map() function and a key however it wasnt fit for purpose for my design or kept breaking so I ended up scrapping it.
I also managed to successfully call the Upgrades API and get it dsiplayed on the page but it didnt fit the theme of my app so I scrapped it

Naturally I went to town on the CSS styling as that is my strong point (and favourite). Saying that, I did ironically decide on a pretty minimalist design so that I can push all the focus on the giant red button on the middle fo the screen.

There are secret messages that appear in the console log
There are functional upgrades in the app that require a certain number or "Infringements" to purchase and will not be clickable until you reach each threshhold. They also manipulate the count of clicks and each interval update so you can reach BIG numbers.

I uploaded the project to Github and Render

I reckon I could have eventually worked a snazzier list and API if I had more time (Mainly because of my current skill and knowledge) into the project but I may actually flesh this project out more in my spare time as I enjoyed it. Plus, not to toot my own horn but I also think its hilarious.

I did struggle quite a bit with the syntax and logic of React but I came to understand it much better as the project went on
